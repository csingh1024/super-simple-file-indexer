Super Simple File Indexer	
  
A multi-threaded text file indexing command line application that prints 10 most repeated words and their counts. 

BUILD

Run "make" in source folder, the executable 'ssfi' will be placed in 'bin' folder

USAGE

$ cd bin
$ ./ssfi --help

"Help" command outputs all supported options. 

By default the application will try to crawl "*.txt" files in "bin" folder (where the executable file is). 
To specify custom directory path, use "-p" option, for instance:

$ ./ssfi -p /usr/share/doc

By default the application will use 10 concurrent threads to crawl text files.
To specify custom number of threads, use "-t" option, for instance:

$ ./ssfi -t 20 -p /usr/share/doc

Also, you can try a set of examples (text books from Project Gutenberg) located in "example" folder. 
For instance:

$ ./ssfi -p ./ssfi -p ../example
